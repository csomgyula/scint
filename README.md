scaled integer representation

## roadmap

* core - proto
  * integer representation
  * sorting
* knapsack - ?
* compression - research
* higher dimension - research
  * sort, compress (e.g. similar to R-Tree)
  * adaptive dimension reduction
* [unique counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count-distinct_problem) - applicability?
