# scint
scaled integer representation

## roadmap

* core - proto
  * integer representation
  * median, percentile search
  * sorting
* research
  * knapsack
  * parallel sort
  * compression
  * higher dimension
    * sort, compress (e.g. similar to R-Tree)
    * adaptive [dimension reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Dimension_reduction)
  * [unique counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count-distinct_problem) - applicability?
